Father: It's not like I had a choice.;n
Mother: Well technically you did. Just had to send the Christmas cards to mom and dad like I asked;n
Mother: But you chose not to.;n
Father: It was not intentional. I am sorry I forgot.;n
Mother: You also don't get to go to your lab today.;n
Father: Whaaat!?;n
Mother: You heard me.;n
Father: :(;n

Father: You know about the game I've been working on?;n
Sid: ---?;n
Father: Yes ---. It's almost done.;n
Sid: Can I test it?;n
Father: Not until it's done.;n
Sid: Oh come on! What's the harm in playing an unfinished game? ;n
Sid: Bugs? I don't mind them. In fact, I love finding them.;n
Father: It's a lot more than that.;n
Father: Plus, I don't have access to my lab today.;n
Father: So either way, you won't be able to play it today.;n
Sid: :/;n
