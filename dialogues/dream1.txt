Demon Lord: You are nothing but a mere mortal who wanted to defy the one true King.;n
Demon Lord: With your fall, this world of yours who put all their worthless hope in your being will fall too.;n
Demon Lord: Consumed in darkness and slowly being devoured by this almighty.;n
Knight: I..I won't let that happen.;n
Demon Lord: Ha! You won't let that happen?;n
Demon Lord: You! Who has fallen on his knees.;n
Demon Lord: Who is barely alive because of the mercy of this True King.;n
Knight: It's true that I am on my knees.;n
Knight: But I still have not fallen.;n
Knight: And I will fight until every fiber of my being ceases to exist.;n
Knight: For I carry the hopes of humanity.;n
Demon Lord: That's commendable!;n
Demon Lord: But why don't you wake up now?;n
Demon Lord: It's almost 10 o'clock.;n
Demon Lord: You better wake up Sid, and come have your breakfast.;n
Knight: Huh! What are you saying?;n
