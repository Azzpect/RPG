Demon Lord: You foolish Knight, how could you even think of defeating me.
Demon Lord: You are nothing but a mere mortal who wanted to defy the one true King.
Demon Lord: With your fall, this world of yours who put all their worthless hope in your being will fall too.
Demon Lord: Consumed in darkness and slowly being devoured by this almighty.
Knight: I..I won't let that happen.
Demon Lord: Ha! You won't let that happen?
Demon Lord: You! Who has fallen on his knees.
Demon Lord: Who is barely alive because of the mercy of this True King.
Knight: It's true that I am on my knees.
Knight: But I still have not fallen.
Knight: And I will fight until every fiber of my being ceases to exist.
Knight: For I carry the hopes of humanity.
Demon Lord: That's commendable!
Demon Lord: But why don't you wake up now?
Demon Lord: It's almost 10 o'clock.
Demon Lord: You better wake up Sid, and come have your breakfast.
Knight: Huh! What are you saying?
