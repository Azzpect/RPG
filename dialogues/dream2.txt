Sid: What happened? Where is Demon Lord?
Mother: What Demon? If you don't wake quickly, I will show what an actual demon is.
Mother: Go wash your face and come down, your father is already there.
Sid: Oh! Ok Mom, I will be there in a few minutes.
Sid: She really came at the best part of the dream... Better hurry up.
