            Sid: Look who's up here to have a little family time today.
            Father: It's not like I had a choice.
            Mother: Well technically you did. Just had to send the Christmas cards to mom and dad like I asked
            Mother: But you chose not to.
            Father: It was not intentional. I am sorry I forgot.
            Mother: You also don't get to go to your lab today.
            Father: Whaaat!?
            Mother: You heard me.
            Father: :(
            Father: Your mother is in a bad mood today kiddo. Better not do anything to ruin it anymore.
            Sid: (Huh, the demon dream kind of makes sense now doesn't it.)
            Sid: Hmmm. What's for lunch mom?
            Mother: --------
            Sid: OMG! Thank you mother!	
            Mother: Wash your hands and sit down.

            Father: You know about the game I've been working on?
            Sid: ---?
            Father: Yes ---. It's almost done.
            Sid: Can I test it?
            Father: Not until it's done.
            Sid: Oh come on! What's the harm in playing an unfinished game? 
            Sid: Bugs? I don't mind them. In fact, I love finding them.
            Father: It's a lot more than that.
            Father: Plus, I don't have access to my lab today.
            Father: So either way, you won't be able to play it today.
            Sid: :/
